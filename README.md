# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Car Rental Website :
Some few assumption for current website are listed below:
* This website is only available for Türkiye, thus the cities list is limited with Türkiye cities.
* After logged in, site again displays log in page in some browsers, go back if that occurs, you will be logged in.
